# err-tell

Want someone to get a message the next time a user is seen in the channel?
No worries, with this plugin you can. The person isn't in the channel? A private
message is sent to get them to join the channel before displaying the message.

* !tell <nick> <msg> - Saves a message to send to <nick>
* !telllist - Lists any unsent messages you have saved
* !tellrm <id> - Removes an unsent message using the <id> from the list command
* !tellstatus - Shows number of unsent messages for each user
* !tellupdate - Updates the internal counts in case of problems
